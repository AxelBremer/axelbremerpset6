### Names
Some method names don't really make sense
##### Example: 
FirstActivity.java line: 80 & 138 onSigned and onCreated
##### How to improve: 
These methods were made to shorten other methods so the names were not really thought of. Improve this by thinking a bit harder about how to name these type of methods.
#### Headers
Headers are present but are not detailed enough.
##### Example: 
Every java file
##### How to improve: 
Spend a little more time on the headers. Maybe add some information about the context (what parameters should be given to this activity etc.)
